# MNIST Digit Predictor

A full-stack AI web app that predicts handwritten digits as you draw them.

- Draw a digit (0â€“9) on a canvas in your browser  
- The app uses a trained AI model to predict the digit in real time  
- Built using React (frontend) and Flask (backend)  
- Model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset  
- Live predictions update every half-second as you draw  

Tech Stack
